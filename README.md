## Overview

Welcome to the “beastt” package! This R package is designed to assist
users in performing Bayesian dynamic borrowing with covariate adjustment
via inverse probability weighting for simulations and data analyses in
clinical trials.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {beastt} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GSK-Biostatistics/beastt")
```

## Usage

At the moment {beastt} covers normal and binomial cases for more
information see the vingettes. We are looking to add survival and
repeated measure cases.
