## Overview

Welcome to the {[beastt](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/beastt/)} package! This R package is designed to assist users in performing Bayesian dynamic borrowing with covariate adjustment via inverse probability weighting for simulations and data analyses in clinical trials.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {beastt} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GSK-Biostatistics/beastt")
```

## Usage

At the moment {beastt} covers cases when borrowing from external control data with either normal or binary endpoints. For more information, see the vignettes. Future updates are expected to include cases with survival endpoints and repeated measure.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the {beastt} package by reporting issues or submitting pull requests on the GitHub repository.
