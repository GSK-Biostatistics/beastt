\arguments{
\item{external_data}{This can either be a \code{prop_scr_obj} created by calling
\code{create_prop_scr()} or a tibble of the external data. If it is just a
tibble the weights will be assumed to be 1. Only the external data for the
arm(s) of interest should be included in this object (e.g., external
control data if creating a power prior for the control Weibull shape and
intercept parameters)}

\item{response}{Name of response variable}

\item{event}{Name of event indicator variable (1: event; 0: censored)}

\item{intercept}{Normal distributional object that is the initial prior for the
intercept (i.e., log-inverse-scale) parameter}

\item{shape}{Integer value that is the scale of the half-normal prior
for the shape parameter}

\item{approximation}{Type of approximation to be used. Either \code{Laplace} or
\code{MCMC}. \code{Laplace} is used by default because it is faster than \code{MCMC}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{rstan::sampling} (e.g. iter, chains).}

\description{
Calculate an approximate (potentially inverse probability weighted)
multivariate normal power prior for the log-shape and log-inverse-scale parameters
of a Weibull likelihood for external time-to-event control data.
}
\details{
Weighted participant-level response data from the control arm of an
external study are incorporated into an approximated inverse probability
weighted (IPW) power prior for the parameter vector
\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}_C = \{\log(\alpha), \beta\}}, where \eqn{\beta = -\log(\sigma)}
is the intercept parameter of a Weibull proportional hazards regression model
and \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\sigma} are the Weibull shape and scale parameters,
respectively. When borrowing information from an external dataset of size \eqn{N_{E}},
the IPW likelihood of the external response data \eqn{\boldsymbol{y}_E} with
event indicators \eqn{\boldsymbol{\nu}_E} and weights \eqn{\hat{\boldsymbol{a}}_0}
is defined as

\deqn{\mathcal{L}_E(\alpha, \sigma \mid \boldsymbol{y}_E, \boldsymbol{\nu}_E,
  \hat{\boldsymbol{a}}_0) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{N_E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\alpha}{\sigma} \right)
  \left( \frac{y_i}{\sigma} \right)^{\alpha - 1} \exp \left( -\left( \frac{y_i}{\sigma} \right)^\alpha
  \right) \right\}^{\hat{a}_{0i} \nu_i} \left\{ \exp \left( -\left( \frac{y_i}{\sigma} \right)^\alpha
  \right) \right\}^{\hat{a}_{0i}(1 - \nu_i)}.}

The initial priors for the intercept parameter \eqn{\beta} and the shape parameter
\eqn{\alpha} are assumed to be normal and half-normal, respectively, which can
be defined using the \code{intercept} and \code{shape} arguments.

The power prior for \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}_C} does not have a closed form, and
thus we approximate it via a bivariate normal distribution; i.e.,
\deqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}_C \mid \boldsymbol{y}_E, \boldsymbol{\nu}_E, \hat{\boldsymbol{a}}_0
  \; \dot\sim \; \mbox{MVN} \left( \tilde{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0, \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_0 \right).}
If \code{approximation = Laplace}, then \eqn{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0} is the mode vector
of the IPW power prior and \eqn{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_0} is the negative
inverse of the Hessian of the log IPW power prior evaluated at the mode. If
\code{approximation = MCMC}, then MCMC samples are obtained from the IPW power prior,
and \eqn{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0} and \eqn{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_0}
are the estimated mean vector and covariance matrix of these MCMC samples.
Note that the Laplace approximation method is faster due to its use of
optimization instead of MCMC sampling.

The first element of the mean vector and the first row/column of covariance
matrix correspond to the log-shape parameter (\eqn{\log(\alpha)}), and the
second element corresponds to the intercept (\eqn{\beta}, the log-inverse-scale)
parameter.
