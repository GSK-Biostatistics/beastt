\title{Calculate Average Distribution from Multiple Distributional Objects}
\usage{
avg_dist(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of distributional objects of the same family (beta,
normal, or multivariate normal).}
}
\value{
A single distributional object of the same family as the input,
with parameters set to the average of all input distribution parameters.
}
\description{
Computes a single "average" distribution from a vector of distributional
objects. This function calculates the mean of each parameter across all
input distributions and returns a new distributional object with these
averaged parameters.
}
\details{
The function supports three distribution families:
\itemize{
\item Beta distributions: Averages the shape1 and shape2 parameters
\item Normal distributions: Averages the mean and sd parameters
\item Multivariate normal distributions: Averages the location vectors
and scale matrices
}

For multivariate normal distributions, both the location vector and scale
matrix are averaged element-wise.
