\format{
\subsection{\code{int_tte_df}}{

A data frame with 150 rows and 6 columns:
\describe{
\item{subjid}{Unique subject ID}
\item{y}{Response (observed event/censored time)}
\item{enr_time}{Enrollment time}
\item{total_time}{Time from study start}
\item{event}{Response, which is binary (0 vs. 1)}
\item{trt}{Treatment indicator, where 0 = control and 1 = active treatment}
\item{cov1}{Covariate 1, which is normally distributed around 65 with a SD of 10}
\item{cov2}{Covariate 2, which is binary (0 vs. 1) with about 30\% of participants having level 1}
\item{cov3}{Covariate 3, which is binary (0 vs. 1) with about 40\% of participants having level 1}
\item{cov4}{Covariate 4, which is binary (0 vs. 1) with about 50\% of participants having level 1}

\description{
This is a simulated dataset used to illustrate Bayesian dynamic borrowing in
the case when borrowing from an external control arm with a time-to-event endpoint,
where the baseline covariate distributions of the internal and external data
are balanced via inverse probability weighting.
